OPP Bluetooth File Distribution Application
(c) Copyright 2011 Amberdms Ltd



OVERVIEW

o4send is an utility developed by Amberdms for use by a company wanting to
distribute files to a number of cellphones (in particular, symbian) as a
form of promotion.

OPP is of limited use - a number of the newer smartphones, notably Android
and iPhone don't currently implement OPP, but a lot of the Nokia and other
Symbian based devices will work with it.



TECHNICAL

If the phone does correctly support OPP, o4send will send them a file which
the user will be prompted to recieve and can then accept/deny.

o4send will distribute the file to the user if requested and then record in
the database either way against the MAC, so that the user is not prompted again.

The database can either be an on disk CSV file or a MySQL database - typically for
a small run, the CSV will be fine. For more complex deployments, the MySQL database
can allow multiple devices to run concurrent o4send instances and better scalability.


EXECUTION

Adjust the configuration inside the app/o4send-srv.pl file - there are options
for testing/debugging as well as DB configuration.

Once completed, execute with:
. app/o4send-srv.pl

Output will be placed into the configured directory and the configured file will be
served up. Note that HTML tends to work best on most phones for sending messages or
links to download additional files or images.
